# A sentinel policy file controls the behavior of security components and how they interact with your build.
# The contents of the file are subject to audit and should be used to circumvent any security controls.
# The file should be named .sentinelpolicy (notice the leading period) and be placed in the root of your repository

# codescanaccess - these entries will add people to be able to view your report in CodeGate UI.  It is typically used
#                  to add a project manager, manager, or director who has not committed code but needs to review results.
#                  This is a comma seperated list and you can more than one of them in the file.  The input is <userid>.

# forcefullscan - Checkmarx by default does incremental scans unless 7% or more of the code changes.  This improves speed.
#                 if you would like a full scan every time (which may improve accuracy or make two scans produce exactly
#                 the same output you can set this value to true.  It is false by default.

#
# codescanpolicy - This determines which preset checkmarx uses for scanning. By default this is OWASP TOP 10 - 2017.
#                  you may be requested to use the PCI preset if your application handles payment card data.  The valid
#                  settings are:
#                  All, OWASP TOP 10 - 2017*, PCI, SANS top 25, Android, HIPAA, Mobile, WordPress, Apple Secure Coding Guide

# suppressionkey - since line numbers and file names change over time the secrets scanner has been enanced with a
#                  suppression key feature.  In the notification you will receive a code that can supress that particular
#                  secret no matter what file, what file line, or what branch it belongs to.  If your file contains NON SECRETS
#                  flagged by the scanner use this efficiently quiet the scanner.  THIS SHOULD NOT be used to disable secrets
#                  detection.  A comment as to why you are supressing the secret MUST be included.  The format is
#                  KEY_FROM_NOTIFICATION;comment.
#
#suppressionkey=574b1fddf;This is a JDBC connection string that has parameterized Password.  There is no hardcoded password.
#suppressionkey=fd543c64e;This is HTTP header value that is publically known and published by a vendor.
suppressionkey=0c79372df; This is google-auth package to install and not a secret.
#
#
# safeline - this is used by the secrets scanner to suppress lines it detected as secrets.  If this is a true secret
#            THIS SHOULD NOT be used to disable secrets detection.  See https://appsec.walmart.com/secrets for
#            proper methods on storing secrets for your application.  Multiple entries are supported within the file.
#            The format is filename;line;comment.  All fields are required.
#
safeline=config.properites;8;This is a username and not a secret.
safeline=ServerDecode.java;19;This is a public key.
safeline=path/to/file/demodata.jsx;9;This is a persons name that is demo data
#
#
# safefile - This is used by the secrets scanner to supress entire files that it detects.  This is mostly triggered by
#            filenames which may trigger the detection.  If your file contains secrets THIS SHOULD NOT be used to disable
#            secrets detection.  See https://appsec.walmart.com/secrets for proper methods on storing secrets for your
#            application.  Multiple entries are supported within the file.  The format is filename;comment.  All fields
#            are required.
#
safefile=secretkeyprocessing.cpp;This processes the secret key but does not contain any.
safefile=GenerateSecretKey.java;This generates keys but does not contain any hardcoded ones.
safefile=path/to/file/ReadSecretKey.java;This reads a key from WCNP but does not contain any keys.

# maxlow - If you would like to block low rated security vulnerabilities in your teams application you can use
#          this setting to set maximum number of lows you would allow. -1 allows all (default), 1 means block all,
#          35 means block if you have more than 35 lows.
#
#
maxlow=-1
#
#
# maxinfo - If you would like to block informational rated security vulnerabilities in your teams application you can use
#           this setting to set maximum number of informationals you would allow. -1 allows all (default), 1 means block all,
#           35 means block if you have more than 35 informationals.
